learn python from basic to advanced

# Notes
- The Python `interpreter` and the `extensive` standard library are freely available in `source or binary` form for all major platforms from the Python web site, https://www.python.org/

- The Python interpreter is easily extended with new functions and data types implemented in C or C++ (or other languages callable from C)

- For a description of `standard objects and modules`, see The Python Standard Library. The Python Language Reference gives a more formal definition of the language. To write extensions in C or C++, read Extending and Embedding the Python Interpreter and Python/C API Reference Manual. There are also several books covering Python in depth.

- Python allows you to split your program into modules that can be reused in other Python programs.

- By default, Python source files are treated as encoded in UTF-8. In that encoding
